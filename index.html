		<h4>Shawna Spoor</h4>
			<p>I work for Harvard in Alumni Affairs and Development and you have probably recieved one of my email masterpieces at some point. I know, I know, email html is a terrible abomination of html. I also work as a site admin for alumni.harvard.edu and act as the core support structure for CMS users of this site and our intranet--ask me about the evils of copying and pasting from Word.</p>
			
			<p>I had never lived on the east coast before moving to Boston. Previous to this I lived in London for 5 years, though I am originally from Southern California. Don't ask me why I moved back from London or why I left Southern California to begin with, I've had to answer those two questions too many times. I love London and my husband is a born and bred Londoner, I will end up back there sooner rather than later but damnit London doesn't have Target, IHOP (even though is purports to be the <strong>International</strong> House of Pancakes), or a proper Halloween spirit.</p>

			<p>I spend most of my time doing homework, working, or traveling. In the last 5 years I've been to 14 countries and and can confidently claim to have been jolly in all of them. When I am not doing any of those things I watch really bad SyFy movies.</p>
