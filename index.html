			<p>I work for Harvard in Alumni Affairs and Development and you have probably recieved one of my email masterpieces at some point. I know, I know, email html is a terrible abomination of html. I also work as a site admin for alumni.harvard.edu and act as the core support structure for CMS users of this site and our intranet--ask me about the evils of copying and pasting from Word.</p>
